            <p>
              You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. It deals
              damage in an area according to your ancestry. When you use your
              breath weapon, all creatures in the area must make a saving throw,
              the type of which is determined by your ancestry. The DC of this
              saving throw is 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency
              bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as
              much damage on a successful one. The damage increase to 3d6 at 6th
              level, 4d6 at 11th, and 5d6 at 16th level. After using your breath
              weapon, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long
              rest.

                While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you
                gain the following benefits:

                <li>Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.</li>

                  Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling
                  (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert

                <li>
                  If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a

              When a creature you can see hits a target that is within 5 feet of
              you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage
              the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of
              0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial
              weapon to use this reaction.
