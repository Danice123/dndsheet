                You choose an area of water that you can see within range and
                that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the
                following ways:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    You instantaneously move or otherwise change the flow of the
                    water as you direct, up to 5 feet in any direction. This
                    movement doesn’t have enough force to cause damage.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You cause the water to form into simple shapes and animate
                    at your direction. This change lasts for 1 hour.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You change the water’s color or opacity. The water must be
                    changed in the same way throughout. This change lasts for 1
                    hour.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You freeze the water, provided that there are no creatures
                    in it. The water unfreezes in 1 hour.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than
                two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you
                can dismiss such an effect as an action.
