                  You make yourself – including your clothing, armor, weapons,
                  and other belongings on your person – look different until the
                  spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can
                  seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in
                  between. You can’t change your body type, so you must adopt a
                  form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise,
                  the extent of the illusion is up to you.

                  The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical
                  inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to
                  your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who
                  touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and
                  hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are,
                  the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump
                  into you while it was seemingly still in midair. To discern
                  that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to
                  inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence
                  (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

                  You choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that
                  you can see within range. A Medium hand made from compacted
                  soil rises there and reaches for one creature you can see
                  within 5 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving
                  throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 bludgeoning
                  damage and is restrained for the spell’s duration.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As an action, you can cause the hand to crush the restrained
                  target, who must make a Strength saving throw. It takes 2d6
                  bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
                  a successful one.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To break out, the restrained target can use its action to make
                  a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the
                  target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different
                  creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within
                  range. The hand releases a restrained target if you do either.
