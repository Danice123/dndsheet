                You touch a willing creature who isn’t wearing armor, and a
                protective magical force surrounds it until the spell ends. The
                target’s base AC becomes 13 + its Dexterity modifier. The spell
                ends if the target dons armor or if you dismiss the spell as an
                action.

                  You hurl a 4-inch-diameter sphere of energy at a creature that
