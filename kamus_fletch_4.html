                You manifest a minor wonder, a sign of supernatural power,
                within range. You create one of the following magical effects
                within range:
                <ul>

                  <li>
                    You cause flames to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color
                    for 1 minute.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You cause harmless tremors in the ground for 1 minute.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You create an instantaneous sound that originates from a
                    point of your choice within range, such as a rumble of
                    thunder, the cry of a raven, or ominous whispers.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window to fly
                    open or slam shut.
                  </li>
                  <li>You alter the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute.</li>

                If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three
                of its 1-minute effects active at a time, and you can dismiss
                such an effect as an action.

                  A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within
                  range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it
                  as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30
                  feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the
                  hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or
                  container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or
                  pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to
                  30 feet each time you use it.

                <p>
                  The hand can’t attack, activate magical items, or carry more
                  than 10 pounds.

                You choose an area of water that you can see within range and
                that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the
                following ways:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    You instantaneously move or otherwise change the flow of the
                    water as you direct, up to 5 feet in any direction. This
                    movement doesn’t have enough force to cause damage.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You cause the water to form into simple shapes and animate
                    at your direction. This change lasts for 1 hour.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You change the water’s color or opacity. The water must be
                    changed in the same way throughout. This change lasts for 1
                    hour.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You freeze the water, provided that there are no creatures
                    in it. The water unfreezes in 1 hour.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than
                two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you
                can dismiss such an effect as an action.
