                You manifest a minor wonder, a sign of supernatural power,
                within range. You create one of the following magical effects
                within range:
                <ul>

                  <li>
                    You cause flames to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color
                    for 1 minute.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You cause harmless tremors in the ground for 1 minute.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You create an instantaneous sound that originates from a
                    point of your choice within range, such as a rumble of
                    thunder, the cry of a raven, or ominous whispers.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window to fly
                    open or slam shut.
                  </li>
                  <li>You alter the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute.</li>

                of its 1-minute effects active at a time, and you can dismiss
                such an effect as an action.

                This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use
                for practice. You create one of the following magical effects
                within range:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such
                    as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes,
                    or an odd odor.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or
                    a small campfire.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1
                    cubic foot.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving
                    material for 1 hour.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an
                    object or a surface for 1 hour.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that
                    can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your
                    next turn.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three

                  A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within
                  range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it
                  as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30
                  feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.

                <p>
                  You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the
                  hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or
                  container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or
                  pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to
                  30 feet each time you use it.

                <p>
                  The hand can’t attack, activate magical items, or carry more
                  than 10 pounds.
