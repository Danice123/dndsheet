              Divine power guards your destiny. If you fail a saving throw or
              miss with an attack roll, you can roll 2d4 and add it to the
              total, possibly changing the outcome. Once you use this feature,

              gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain
              additional sorcery points. You can transform unexpended sorcery
              points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. You can
              create spell slots no higher in level than 5th. Any spell slot you

              When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't

              equal to the spell's level to target a second creature in range

                Increase your Intelligence or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum

              <li>
                When you roll fire damage for a spell you cast, you can reroll
                any roll of 1 on the fire damage dice, but you must use the new
                roll, even if it is another 1.
              </li>
              <li>
                Whenever you cast a spell that deals fire damage, you can cause
                flames to wreathe you until the end of your next turn. The
                flames don’t harm you or your possessions, and they shed bright
                light out to 30 feet and dim light for an additional 30 feet.
                While the flames are present, any creature within 5 feet of you
                that hits you with a melee attack takes 1d4 fire damage.
