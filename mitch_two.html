            <p>
              When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee
              weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action
              to attack with a different light melee weapon that you’re holding
              in the other hand. You don’t add your ability modifier to the
              damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative. If
              either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon,
              instead of making a melee attack with it.

              Once per turn, you can deal an extra 2d6 damage to one creature
              you hit with an attack with a finesse or ranged weapon if you have
              advantage on the attack roll. You don’t need advantage on the
              attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 ft. of it,
              that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on
              the attack roll.

              You have learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon,
              and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal
              conversation. It takes four times longer to convey such a message
              than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

              Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

              You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to
              make a Sleight of Hand check, use your thieves’ tools to disarm a
              trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.

              Increase your INT by 1. If you can see a creature's mouth while it
              is speaking a language you understand, you can interpret what it's
              saying by reading its lips. You have a +5 bonus to your passive
              Perception and passive Investigation scores.

              Increase your Dexterity score by 1. You gain proficiency with
              firearms. You ignore the loading property of firearms. Being
              within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on
              your ranged attack rolls.
